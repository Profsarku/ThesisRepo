            authors: ["Dr. Kwame Asante", "Prof. Fatima Al-Rashid", "Dr. Chinedu Okafor"],
            abstract: "This study presents novel machine learning algorithms for predicting crop yields in smallholder farming systems across Sub-Saharan Africa. Using satellite imagery and meteorological data from 2015-2023, we developed ensemble models that achieve 89% accuracy in yield prediction. The methodology incorporates local agricultural practices and climate variability patterns specific to the region. Results demonstrate significant potential for improving food security through precision agriculture techniques adapted for resource-constrained environments.",
